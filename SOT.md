## 1. Product Statement

DomoNote is an open-source, local-first AI secretary and note-taking workspace.
- **Tagline**: "Capture it. Understand it. Keep it."
- **Secondary Description**: "DomoNote — Your Local AI Secretary for meetings, documents, and notes."

DomoNote integrates five primary knowledge and capture modalities into a unified workspace:
1. **Markdown & Structured Notes**: Full Markdown editing with version history and folder organization.
2. **Meeting Recording, Speaker Detection & Live Timelines**: High-fidelity microphone and tab audio recording, speaker tracking, live speech-to-text, multilingual AI translation, and automatic synthesis of action items and decisions.
3. **Document / PDF Intelligence**: PDF.js canvas engine with coordinate-anchored annotations, text selection AI actions, and automated "Turn into Steps" conversion.
4. **Computer Operation Capture & SOP Manual Generator**: Screen procedure recording, click coordinate annotation, and one-click export to PDF, Markdown, JSON, and HTML.
5. **Native Desktop Shells & Browser Extensions**: Dedicated native desktop applications for macOS and Windows with system tray HUDs, and a Google Meet capture extension.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

1. **Local-First Storage**: All user notes, meetings, audio recordings, uploaded PDFs, annotations, and generated manuals are persisted client-side in IndexedDB via Dexie. No remote database or mandatory server is required for full functionality.
2. **Vercel & Static Host Compatibility**: The web application is built strictly as a client-side React Single Page Application (SPA) using Vite. It builds without Node.js backend runtime requirements and is deployable to static hosts such as Vercel.
3. **Decoupled Local AI**: Local intelligence communicates with Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`. If Ollama is offline or unavailable, the application provides clear visual status and diagnostic instructions rather than failing or substituting synthetic responses.
4. **Privacy and Zero Telemetry**: No user data, uploaded documents, or transcripts are transmitted to third-party cloud services. Operating system and browser permissions are requested explicitly.
5. **Real Data Integrity**: The application does not generate or display synthetic filler cards, fake statistics, or mock AI completions. Empty states are explicitly communicated.
6. **Grayscale Visual Discipline**: The visual system is strictly black, white, and grayscale. Saturated accent colors are restricted to semantic states (recording active, connection status, alerts). Emojis are prohibited across UI icons and documentation.
7. **Safe Binary Delivery**: Download links for native installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.zip`, `.AppImage`) must deliver genuine PE/Mach-O binaries. SPA web servers must never rewrite binary download paths to `index.html`. Automated fallbacks forward directly to official GitHub Releases.

## 4. Entity Data Models

All entities are defined with strict TypeScript typing and indexed in IndexedDB:

### 4.1 Note
- `id`: string (UUID)
- `title`: string
- `content`: string (Markdown)
- `folderId?`: string
- `tags`: string[]
- `createdAt`: number (timestamp)
- `updatedAt`: number (timestamp)
- `versions`: NoteVersion[] (id, timestamp, content, title)

### 4.2 Meeting
- `id`: string (UUID)
- `title`: string
- `startTime`: number
- `endTime?`: number
- `durationSeconds`: number
- `audioBlobId?`: string (reference to Blobs table)
- `transcript`: TranscriptSegment[] (id, timestampSeconds, speaker, text)
- `manualNotes`: string
- `timeline`: TimelineItem[] (timestampSeconds, label, type)
- `summary?`: MeetingSummary (overview, decisions, actionItems, topics, followUpTasks)

### 4.3 Document
- `id`: string (UUID)
- `title`: string
- `fileName`: string
- `fileSize`: number
- `pageCount`: number
- `fileBlobId`: string (reference to Blobs table)
- `extractedPages`: ExtractedPage[] (pageNumber, text)
- `createdAt`: number

### 4.4 Annotation
- `id`: string (UUID)
- `documentId`: string

## 5. Security & Privacy Boundaries

1. **XSS Prevention**: Raw markdown is rendered through React Markdown with dangerous HTML execution disabled and sanitized with DOMPurify.
2. **File Upload Verification**: PDF uploads are validated for valid PDF headers (`%PDF-`) and size-constrained client-side.
3. **Network Isolation**: All outbound network requests from the web application target either localhost (Ollama port 11434, companion port 8765) or are completely client-side.
4. **Permissions Principle**: Microphone and Screen Sharing APIs are invoked only upon direct user action. Visual indicators remain conspicuous during active recording.

## 6. Multi-Platform Distribution & Download Protocol

To guarantee reliable binary distribution:
1. **GitHub Releases as Canonical Distribution**:
   - Official release binaries are compiled via CI/CD and hosted on GitHub Releases (`https://github.com/darknecrocities/DomoNote/releases`).
2. **SPA Rewrite Protection**:
   - Static hosting configuration (`vercel.json`) must exclude `/downloads/` from SPA root rewrites.
3. **Smart Client-side Probe**:
   - When users click download, the web client performs a HEAD probe on the local route. If the route returns a route-rewritten HTML file rather than a genuine binary, it automatically redirects to the canonical GitHub Release URL.
4. **Desktop Installer Verification**:
   - Installers must be verified directly on physical hardware and runner environments (silent install, shortcut resolution, clean uninstallation).

---

## 7. CI/CD & Quality Assurance

- **Continuous Integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)**:
  - Runs on all pushes and pull requests to `main`.
  - Matrix testing across Node.js 20 & 22 on Linux runners.
  - Full TypeScript compilation (`tsc -b`), Vitest test suite execution, and production build verification.
  - Native Windows desktop app and installer compilation on `windows-latest` with verification of artifact existence and silent install test.
- **Automated Releases (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)**:
  - Triggers on tag pushes (`v*`) or manual dispatch.
  - Compiles `DomoNote-Setup-x64.exe`, `DomoNote-Windows-Portable.zip`, and `DomoNote-Setup.bat`.
  - Generates `SHA256SUMS.txt` cryptographic checksums.
  - Creates a GitHub Release with assets attached.
- **Git Commit Standards**:
  - Conventional Commits: `feat(...)`, `fix(...)`, `docs(...)`, `chore(...)`, `refactor(...)`, `test(...)`.
  - Strictly no emojis in commit messages, code comments, or documentation.
